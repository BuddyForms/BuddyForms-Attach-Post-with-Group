Create engaged communities with every post.

== Description ==

This is the BuddyForms Attach Posts to Groups Extension. You need the BuddyForms plugin installed for the plugin to work. <a href="http://themekraft.com/store/wordpress-front-end-editor-and-form-builder-buddyforms/" target="_blank">Get BuddyForms now!</a>

With this plugin, you’ll be able to automatically create a new BuddyPress group for pre-assigned BuddyForms post submissions and attach that group to the post. User-submitted posts with BuddyForms then become a BuddyPress group with all the included functionality and endless possibilities.

<h4>Now “why would you want to create groups for every post”, you ask? </h4>Here’s some quick examples of why it’s the perfect plugin to help grow your community and business:

1) You have a product-based website and use two post types: a "Product" post type and a “Brand" post type… Every product can then easily be categorized as a product of a brand. Every Product and Brand can be a Group so you can have forums or contact persons etc available product specific or centralised in the brand.

2) You have a listing website that users directly add events to. Wouldn’t it be great if a group was automatically created whenever a user creates a new event? The event suddenly has access to members, forums, & everything else possible within BuddyPress groups!

<h4>How It Works? </h4>
Create and attach new BuddyPress groups to your posts created with BuddyForms. Whenever a new post is created, a group is also created (you of course get to choose which post types create groups in BuddyForms). The permalink will be rewritten to the group (only for custom post types) and a redirect will publish the posts to the attached group (works for all post types).

<h4> Great Features </h4>
Here’s the list of powerful features that will help manage your BuddyPress groups:

* Categorize your groups with all the power WordPress already provides.
* Get the combined benefits of WordPress posts and taxonomies with the added power of BuddyPress groups.
* Filter and sort groups in a newly designed and intuitive way.
* Organize your groups within categories and custom post types.
* Use ANY 3rd party post-type based plugins and power them up with BuddyPress Groups.
* BONUS: We introduce a new "Attach Group Type" form element to the Form Builder to attach groups to other groups. Create complex relationships between your groups for every custom post type which is attached to groups.
