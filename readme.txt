Create engaged communities with every post.

== Description ==

This is the BuddyForms Attach Post with Group extension. You need the BuddyForms plugin installed for the plugin to work. <a href="http://buddyforms.com" target="_blank">Get BuddyForms now!</a>

With this plugin, you’ll automatically be able to create a new BuddyPress group for pre-assigned BuddyForms post submissions and attach that group to the post. Then User-submitted posts with BuddyForms become a BuddyPress group with all the included functionality and endless possibilities.

<h4>Now “why would you want to create groups for every post”, you ask? </h4>Here’s some quick examples of why it’s the perfect plugin to help your community and business grow:

1) You have a product-based website and use two post types: a "Product" post type and a “Brand" post type. Every product can then easily be categorized as a product of a brand. Every Product and Brand can be a group, so you can have forums or contact persons etc - available product specific or centralised in the brand.

2) You have a listing website that users directly add events to. Wouldn't it be great if a group would be automatically created whenever a user creates a new event? The event suddenly has access to members, forums & everything else - possible within BuddyPress groups!

<h4>How It Works?</h4>
Create and attach new BuddyPress groups to your posts with BuddyForms. Whenever a new post is created, a group is also created (of course you get to choose, which post types create groups in BuddyForms). The permalink will be rewritten to the group and a redirect will publish the posts to the attached group.

<h4>Great Features </h4>
Here’s the list of powerful features that will help manage your BuddyPress groups:

<ul>
<li>* Categorize your groups with all the power WordPress already provides.</li>
<li>* Get the combined benefits of WordPress posts and taxonomies with the added power of BuddyPress groups.</li>
<li>* Filter and sort groups in a new designed and intuitive way.</li>
<li>* Organize your groups within categories and custom post types.</li>
<li>* Use ANY 3rd party post-type based plugins and power them up with BuddyPress Groups.</li>
<li>* Attach Group Type to attach groups to other groups. Create complex relationships between your groups for every form which is attached to groups.</li>
<li>* 3 widgets to display your groups relations in your group sidebar</li>
<li>* Edit the post from the Group Admin</li>
</ul>

<h4>Display Post in the Group</h4>
<ul>
<li>nothing - <i>great if you want to use the home tab</i></li>
<li>create a new tab - <i>Will add anew Tab to your Group Tabs</i></li>
<li>before group activity - <i>Hook your Post content before the Group Activity</i></li>
</ul>

<h4>Overwrite Templates</h4>
If you want to add the post to the home tab, you need to copy the single-post.php from 'includes/templates/buddyforms/groups/single-post.php' to your theme and rename it to front.php 'groups/single/front.php'.
If you want to change the new tab template, copy single-post.php to your theme 'buddyforms/groups/single-post.php

<h4>User Rights Management</h4>
In BuddyForms its already possible to manage Roles an Capability's.
With the Attached Posts to Groups extension all Admins of the group will have the rights to edit the post too.
